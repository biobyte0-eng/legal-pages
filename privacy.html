    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-17</p>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This site/app (“<strong>APP NAME</strong>”) is operated by <strong>YOUR NAME / COMPANY</strong>
      (“we”, “us”, “our”). Contact: <strong>YOUR CONTACT EMAIL</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>2) What this app does</h2>
    <p>
      This app helps a user retrieve and analyze YouTube channel/video analytics and metadata to produce reports
      (for example CSV/Parquet exports) for the user’s own use.
    </p>

    <h2>3) Services used</h2>
    <p>
      This app uses <strong>YouTube API Services</strong>.
      (<a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube API Services Developer Policies</a>)
    </p>

    <h2>4) Information we access</h2>
    <p>
      With your permission, the app may access data from your Google/YouTube account via Google APIs,
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>YouTube Analytics data (e.g., views, watch time, audience retention metrics, engagement metrics).</li>
      <li>YouTube video/channel metadata (e.g., video IDs, titles, publish timestamps, privacy status).</li>
      <li>Authentication tokens needed to access the APIs on your behalf.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">
      The specific data accessed depends on the Google OAuth scopes you authorize (for example,
      <code>yt-analytics.readonly</code>, <code>youtube.readonly</code>, <code>youtube.force-ssl</code>).
    </p>

    <h2>5) How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To fetch YouTube analytics/metadata you requested.</li>
      <li>To compute derived metrics (e.g., 7-day totals) and generate exports/reports for you.</li>
      <li>To maintain a local cache of previously fetched results to reduce API calls and improve reliability.</li>
      <li>For security and debugging (e.g., diagnosing API errors), when necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We only share data in limited situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers you use</strong>: for example, storing export files in your own cloud storage
        (such as Google Drive) at your direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal/security</strong>: to comply with law or protect against abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use)</h2>
    <p>
      Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>,
      including the <strong>Limited Use</strong> requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain Google/YouTube data only as long as needed to provide the app’s functionality (for example,
      keeping cached exports so you don’t have to refetch). You can request deletion at any time (see Section 10).
    </p>

    <h2>9) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data and tokens (for example, limiting access to the account/storage
      where exports and tokens are kept). No method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Your choices: revoke access and delete data</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Revoke access:</strong> You can revoke this app’s access to your Google account at any time via Google’s
      security settings page:
      <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Delete data:</strong> To delete stored data, you can (a) delete any exported files created by the app
      in your storage, and (b) contact us at <strong>YOUR CONTACT EMAIL</strong> for deletion assistance if needed.
      If you revoke access, we will delete any Google API data we have stored that is associated with that access.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Third-party links</h2>
    <p>
      This site may link to third-party sites. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the effective date above.
    </p>
